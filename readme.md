The "Zombie to GPX"-Generator

Check it out here: http://www.philippveit.de/zombie/
and don't forget my Blog about Iceland: http://philippveit.de/

Do you miss the function of getting a GPX-File after your run in Zombies, Run? Then here is the solution.

Just enter the URL to your Run in the Textfield below. The URL should look like this: https://www.zombiesrungame.com/kruemelnerd/195912/ 
With this information a gpx-file will be generated. 
This you can use for updating your profile at endomondo.com or runkeeper.com

Please notice that this gpx-generator has nothing to do with Sixtostart or Naomi Alderman, the creators of the game zombiesrungame.com

If something doesn't work right, feel free to give me some infos by Twitter http://twitter.com/kruemelnerd or by mail zombiesrungpx@philippveit.de
